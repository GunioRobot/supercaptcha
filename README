Usage:

	class MySuperForm(forms.Form):
	      ...
	      captcha = supercaptcha.CaptchaField(label=u'no robots here')
	      ...

You don't need any changes in form, or middleware or context processor or
other boring things.

All you need, to get captcha working is properly configured cache backend.
And surely PIL library installed.
